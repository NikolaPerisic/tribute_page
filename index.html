     <h3>Jacque Fresco is one of my favourite authors. He was an American self-taught structural designer, architectural designer, concept artist, educator, and futurist. Fresco wrote and lectured his views of sustainable cities, energy efficiency, natural resource management, cybernetic technology, advanced automation, and the role of science in society. He was also the co-founder and director of The Venus Project. As an outspoken social critic, Fresco advocated global implementation of a socioeconomic system of social cooperation, technological automation, and scientific methodology, which he refered to as a ‘resource-based economy’. He died on May 18<sup>th</sup> 2017 in Sebring, Florida, USA.</h3>
